Playerâ€™s Table is a generic tabletop environment that currently only allows for a user to play tabletop games. In the current build, a user can open an empty table and spawn tokens, and can start a game mode that allows one to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

Dependencies:
  - Godot 4.4
  - Windows System
    
How to install & run: 
To be able to run the following zip file in your own Godot environment, you will need to download "Player'sTable.zip" and extract the file to a desired location. Next, you will need to use the import button in your Godot Project Manager list, locate the folder containing the project, and select it. It is titled "playerstablemenu". After this is done, you can select the project and load it. Once inside the project, you can view and edit 
Scene scripts by navigating to the file system and double-clicking on any scenes:

Right above the file system is a window that displays the current selected scene's contents. To view a script, click on the while paper icon:

If you want to only run a scene, make sure to have one selected and click the clapboard icon in the top right:

Usage: 
Its intended purpose is to allow users to take any generic real-life tabletop game and import it into our modular source code. In its current build, users can play a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It is a baseline model for a simple tabletop simulator.
