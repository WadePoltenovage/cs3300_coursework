Instructions:

- Standard Uno with Jump-Ins (Same card can be played twice, explanation later)
- First card in the center pile is always Blue-7. 
- To play a card:
	- Should always be typed as, for example: Blue-7 or Green-5 
	- Special cards are as they appear in your text file
	- Should always be typed as, for example: Yellow-Reverse or Red-Skip
	- Wild +4 is Wild-+4
	- No need to call Uno on last card
- To draw a card you must type: Draw-Card

Speaking of which, your hand is in a text in the project file. Each player must re-open
the file after each turn for an updated version on the file. This is why we're including 
jump-ins, the game is very slow without them.
